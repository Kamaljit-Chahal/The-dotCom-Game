# The-dotCom-Game
This is the dotCom (aka Battleship) game I developed during the ExperienceIT 2015 program.
It is the basic version, i.e. console based.

The grid is 7x7 with three 3 dotComs pre-populated on the grid. Each dotCom takes up 3 consecutive grid spaces. The initital print code gives instructions for entering guesses.
