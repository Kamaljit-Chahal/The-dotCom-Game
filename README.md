# The-dotCom-Game
This is my dotCom (aka Battleship) game developed during the ExperienceIT 2015 program.
It is the basic version, i.e. it is console based.

The grid is 7x7 with three 3 dotComs pre-populated on the grid. Each dotCom takes up 3 consecutive grid spaces. The program gives instructions for entering guesses. 

It is uploaded as an Eclipse Mars project. Import as existing project.
